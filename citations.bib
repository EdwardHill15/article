	abstract = {Regular physical exercise has been known to be beneficial in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological studies of physical exercise: previous non-randomized studies suggested that a life-style intervention program involving diet and/or exercise reduced the progression of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes. Recent randomized controlled intervention trials also showed that diet and/or exercise intervention led to a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes among those with IGT. Endocrinological and metabolic effects of exercise: in well controlled diabetic patients, physical exercise promotes utilization of blood glucose and lowers blood glucose levels. On the other hand, in poorly controlled diabetic patients with ketosis, physical exercise results in further rises in blood glucose, free fatty acids and ketone body concentrations. Long-term gentle regular jogging increases insulin action in respect of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism despite no influence on body mass index or maximal oxygen uptake. A significant correlation was observed between DMCR (insulin sensitivity) and average daily steps (P {\textless} 0.005) Our recent data suggested that the improvement of insulin action by physical exercise was attributed, at least in part, to the increase in insulin-sensitive GLUT4 (glucose transporter 4) on the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, as an adjunct to other forms of therapy, mild regular physical exercise will play an important role in primarily preventing type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Levels of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) are elevated in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and may contribute to vascular complications. In this study we tested the hypothesis that elevated ADMA in patients with DM1 can be reduced by regular physical exercise. METHODS: Plasma samples for analysis of L-arginine, ADMA, symmetrical dimethylarginine (SDMA) and metabolic parameters were obtained from 11 patients with DM1 who participated in a supervised aerobic exercise program for four months. Samples were collected before the training began, at two and four months after initiation, and eight months after cessation of regular training. Fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy persons who did not exercise regularly were examined once as controls and did not participate in the training program. RESULTS: The patients with DM1 had higher ADMA levels than the controls before the training program began (0.54 ± 0.02 vs. 0.44 ± 0.03 μmol/l; P {\textless} 0.05). After two and four months of exercise, ADMA concentrations in the patients decreased to those seen in healthy persons (0.42 ± 0.02 and 0.43 ± 0.03 μmol/l; P {\textless} 0.001 and P {\textless} 0.05 compared with ADMA levels before training began). Eight months after cessation of the exercise program, ADMA levels in the patients reverted to those observed before the start of training. The L-arginine-to-ADMA ratio increased slightly after two months; L-arginine, symmetrical dimethylarginine, blood lipids and HbA1c were not affected by the training program. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated ADMA levels in patients with DM1, who have a high risk for developing cardiovascular disease, can be lowered to those of healthy persons by regular physical exercise. This favorable effect on ADMA is not sustained when training is discontinued.},
